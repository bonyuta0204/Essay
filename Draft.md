# Draft of Essay of PSY360
## Instruction of the essay

Page: 8 - 12 pages without abstraction, title, references  
Format: APA   
Content: must be structured like a research manuscript (without data). It has to be constructed as three distinctive part.  
### Part1
Introduction and Literature review. Most of citation has to be written in year 2000+. Has to state why it is relevant. You must describe predictions/hypotheses, the rationale for expected findings, as well as descriptions of how these findings add to the existing literature.   
**3 - 4 pages**
### Part2
Part 2) Design a study that would test or expand the idea(s) you have about this topic. 
The study design and procedures should be appropriate for the goals of the study, and be described in enough detail so that it could potentially be replicated. Your proposed sample should be described, including information on recruitment. Address and/or clarify any potential ethical concerns (risks and potential benefits), as relevant. Risks to participants almost always exist and generally fall into psychological, physical, social or group risk categories. In this section, you should also state what data is being collected, the means of data collection (for example, is it a diary method, online, laboratory in-person, etc.), and how the data will be handled/analyzed. Data analysis plans should be appropriate to the design and research question; it should be described in a way that allows another researcher to replicate/conduct these analyses, if they had your (hypothetical) data. Expected results should be described/reiterated.  
** (approx. 4 pages) **

### Part3
Part 3) Applications & Conclusions. This section of your proposal should be focused on benefits to society and real people out there. The findings may have academic merit, but what is the relevance to real life and real people? How does this idea/finding potentially (or actually) benefit people out there in terms of living a full life? Applications described can be focused on non-clinical or clinical applications; however, given the focus of this course, positive psychology, you are encouraged to think beyond clinical applications. In addition, describe the relevance of the study and its findings to positive psychology as a discipline. In your concluding remarks, discuss the potential/expected findings in the context of the existing literature, discuss limitations and directions for future research.

## Memo
### Schedule of this essay.

| Time   | what to do |
|--------|---------|
|Monday | collect literature and do research. At least, finish making concrete theme and start to write part1|
|Tuesday |start to work on part2 and part3.  |
|Wednesday |finish writing |

### Brainstorming of theme
+ Positive Intervention
	+ Power of positive intervention. How effective it is. 
	+ Long lasting effect of positive action intervention
	+ Why it can overcome hedonic adaptation if it really has long lasting effect on SWB.
	+ Cultural differences of effect of positive intervention

### Content of essay
### Part1 
Introduction 
+ Brief review of positive psychology
+ Brief review of positive intervention 
+ Theme of this essay (long lasting effect of positive intervention)
	+ Review of past literature 
		+ Positive activity intervention. Debate about long lasting effect of PAI. Some research show that it has as long as 6 months effect. But most of the research of PAI were just conducted for less than 12 month. There is less evidence about long lasting effect of PAIs. And needed amount of PAI. There is a theory which suggest that, PAI may benefit because it can train people to feel positive emotion. Even though Lyubomirsky suggest that 40% of out happiness is based on what we think and how we behave. Is this true? Is it really able to escape from hedonic treadmill?
		+ Hedonic treadmill. Human beings tend to adapt to external environment much faster than people think. (More evidence needed). Isn't PAI is part of them?'
	+ Why it is relevant
	+ Goal of the essay
	+ Hypotheses
	+
### Part2 


Must be concrete procedure of the experiment
### Memo
#### What should be included in this part?
+ Procedure 
	+ How to gather participants
	+ How to collect data
	+ How to measure their level of happiness 
	+ How to analyze it.
	+ internventions they are asked to perform .

#### Goal of this study and hypotheses.  
to show that whether pepople utilize intervention intentionally is crucial to long lasting effect of positive intervention.Because intrinsic positive intervention induce positive emotions and positive emotion induce WB. what has to be shown is that.

1. the extent people enjoy and repeat PAI correlate with longer effect of increase in WB
2. the extent of people enjoy PAI predict the frequency they feel in thier life
3. the frequency of people feel positive emotion predicts increase of WB. 



**Mechanism of lasitng happiness by intervention**

PAI => people enjoy and learn how to utilize it. => people use it with relatively effortlessly to boost their positive emotions.=> positive emotion induce WB.

**Mechanism of not lasting happiness by intervention**

PAI => after while, people no more enjoy it because of hedonic adaptation => don't get leap in positive emotion. => no more gain in WB.

#### what to measure 

+ how much they use it after instructed period
+ how much the PAI provoke positive emotion.
+ (strength of positive emotion in their life)
+ increase of their happiness level. 

**How to measure and what to measure**

the way to measure it. => to compare the correlation of how much enjoyed and how long the boost of positive effect lasts.   

| Short span happiness                 | Long lasting WB                    |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Positive emotion after PAI is higher at first but decrease as time passes| Positive emotion PAI is higher and decreases slowly comapared to Short span one| 
|**They does not utillize PAI after instructed period** | **They utilize PAI after instructed period**  |
|Thier level of happiness decrease in certain period  |Thier level of happinee is higher for long term |

#### Method of this research

+ length: 8 months
+ participants: Student in Psychology class
	+ they have incentive of grade to keep participating the essay

#### Part3 


## Research 
### Positive Psychology Progress Empirical Validation of Interventions by Seligman et al.
> These activities are similar in that they are all relatively brief, self-administered, and non-stigmatizing exercises that promote positive feelings, positive thoughts, and/or positive behaviors, rather than directly aiming to fi x negative or pathological feelings, thoughts, and behaviors. For

Emerging science of positive psychology: the study of positive
Emotion, positive character, and positive institutions (Seligman & Csikszentmihalyi, 2000).  
Some studies did a research on application of positive PSY ((Linley & Joseph, 2004).)  
**In this article, we first review the recent growth within
Positive psychology. Next, we describe basic research that bears on whether people can become lastingly happier, and then we present the results of our own happiness interventions that we rigorously tested with a randomized, placebo- controlled design**

We focus the rest of this article on the efficacy of psycho- logical interventions to increase individual happiness, in many ways the bottom line of work in positive psychology

One nonobvious reason to be interested in interventions that build happiness is that happiness is not an epiphenomenon. E.g. happiness is causal and bring many benefit besides feeling good.

>From the Buddha, through the human potential movement of the 1960s, through the pioneering work of Michael Fordyce (1977, 1983), through the self-improvement industry of the 1990s, at least 100 “interventions” claiming to increase happiness lastingly have been proposed.

>Research into the hedonic treadmill, adaptation, and the heritability of positive affectivity has implied that people adapt rapidly to positive changes in their world and soon return to their baseline levels of happiness (Brickman & Campbell, 1971; Kahneman, 1999; Lykken & Tellegen, 1996

#### Procedure of this experiment
Used internet to find participants and collect data  
Used 5 activities. Each activities are **completed in one week**

#### Result 
Two of these exercise increased happiness and decreased depressive symptoms for **six months**. Another one (gratitude visit) largely increased happiness level for one month. Surprisingly, the degree to which participants actively continued their assigned exercise on their own and beyond the prescribed one week period mediated the long-term benefits.
###### Comment
Length of research was for six months. Therefore there is possibility that there were longer effect of the intervention.

#### Discussion
What caused the long-term effect?  
Instruction just explicitly stated that perform the intervention for a week.  
The interaction between continuing the exercise and adherence to the exercise was significant for happiness scores, indicating that participants who continued the ex- excises were the happiest.

>We believe that these two interventions involve skills that improve with practice, that are fun, and that thus are self-maintaining.

#### Definitions
Epiphenomenon: a secondary effect or byproduct that arises from but does not causally influence a process.

#### Memo of this article
Memo of this article. This article suggest that positive intervention can last for longer times. Despite the theory of hedonic treadmill, positive intervention has possibility that it can make long lasting effect on people’s happiness level. '
It also shows that to continue intervention is essential for long lasting benefit of positive interventions.

### Enhancing Well-Being and Alleviating Depressive Symptoms with Positive Psychology Interventions: A Practice-Friendly Meta-Analysis by Nancy and Lyubomirsky

#### Introduction
Increasingly, psychological well-being (WB) is viewed as not only the absence of mental disorder but also the presence of positive psychological resources, including components of hedonic or subjective well-being (e.g., positive affect, life satisfaction, happiness; Diener, 1984)
>positive psychology interventions (PPIs)? That is, treatment methods or intentional activities that aim to cultivate positive feelings, behaviors, or cognitions. For instance, PPI strategies as diverse as writing gratitude letters, practicing optimistic thinking, replaying positive experiences, and socializing have been shown to increase WB in nonclinical samples (e.g., Fordyce, 1977; Lyubomirsky, Dickerhoof, Boehm, & Sheldon, 2008; Ruini, Belaise, Brombin, Caffo, & Fava, 2006)

#### Procedure
**Meta-analysis**
**important**: **all literature is shorter than 12weeks**

#### Result
>Intervention duration. Longer interventions produced greater gains WB based on the fixed effects model, and this effect approached significance according to the random effects model (one-tailed p5.09)
>The combined results of 49 studies revealed that PPIs do, in fact, significantly enhance WB, and the combined results of 25 studies showed that PPIs are also effective for treating depressive symptoms. The magnitude of these effects is medium-sized (mean r5.29 for WB, mean r5.31 for depression), indicating that not only do PPIs work, they work well.
> Individual therapy was most effective, followed by group-administered PPIs, then self-administered PPIs

### THE HOW, WHY, WHAT, WHEN, AND WHO OF HAPPINESS. Mechanisms Underlying the Success of Positive Activity Interventions by Lyubomirsky
#### Introduction
>however, that changing one’s life circumstances (e.g., marital status, career, location, and income) is not the most fruitful path to greater well-being (Sheldon & Lyubomirsky, 2006a)
>A common argument from skeptics is that people’s happiness levels are genetically determined and cannot be substantively changed. Despite persuasive evidence from twin studies that well-being levels are strongly influenced by genetics (Lykken & Tellegen, 1996)
>Such findings suggest that trying to become happier by improving one’s life circumstances? If those circumstances are not dreadful to begin with is unlikely to pay off.
>We argue instead that these observed changes can be explained in part by deliberate ways that people choose to think and behave in their daily lives

Definition of PAI  
>Positive activity interventions (PAIs) involve simple, self-administered cognitive behavioral strategies designed to mirror the thoughts and behaviors of naturally happy people and, in turn, improve the happiness of the person performing them.
> These activities are similar in that they are all relatively brief, self-administered, and non-stigmatizing exercises that promote positive feelings, positive thoughts, and/or positive behaviors, rather than directly aiming to fi x negative or pathological feelings, thoughts, and behaviors. For
> 
> The length of an intervention may also bolster the benefits garnered from performing a particular activity, such that the longer the intervention, the greater the increase to well-being (Sin & Lyubomirsky, 2009)

> And rewarding (Berlyne, 1970; Pronin & Jacobs, 2008; Rolls et al., 1981). College students report being less likely to adapt to dynamic life changes (e.g., those that involve continued engagement in a variable, self-directed process, like taking a language class or making a new friend) than to static ones (e.g., acquiring a better dorm room or more financial aid; Sheldon & Lyubomirsky, 2006a; Study 1

> Furthermore, at a 15-month follow-up to an 8-week loving-kindness meditation training, participants who continued to meditate after the intervention period reported more positive emotions than non-continuers (Cohn & Fredrickson, 2010)
> 
> But instead as a tool that people are conscious of and can deploy when needed. If the positive activity is practiced long enough during the intervention that it becomes habitual, then applying it in later times of need will be relatively effortless and automatic. Research
> 
> Three studies have demonstrated that people who engage in positive activities even after the prescribed study period continue to show improvements in well-being over a control group (Cohn & Fredrickson, 2010; Lyubomirsky et al., 2011; Seligman et al., 2005)>

### Variety is the spice of happiness: The hedonic adaptation prevention (HAP) model.
#### Intoduction
>Sustainable Happiness Model: Our early work regarding these questions focused on the Sustainable Happiness Model (SHM; Lyubomirsky, Sheldon, & Schkade, 2005; Sheldon & Lyubomirsky, 2004, 2006), which divides the possible influences on SWB into three broad categories: genetics, circumstances, and activities (see Figure 1).
It suggest that Intentional activities occupies 40% of variety of happiness level, whereas set point occupies 50% and Circumstances occupies 10%  
>e (Emmons & McCullough, 2003; Froh, Sefick, & Emmons, 2008; Lyubomirsky et al., 2005; Lyubomirsky, Dickerhoof, Boehm, & Sheldon, 2009; Seligman, Steen, Park, & Peterson, 2005), contemplating best possible selves (Burton & King, 2008; Lyubomirsky et al., 2009), committing acts of kindness (Dunn, Aknin, & Norton, 2008; Lyubomirsky et al., 2005; Otake, Shimai, Tanaka-Matsumi, Otsui, & Fredrickson, 2006), working on using personal strengths (Seligman et al., 2005), replaying one’s happiest days (Lyubomirsky, Sousa, & Dickerhoof, 2006), and pausing to appreciate, savor, or be mindful of the good things in one’s life (Fredrickson, Cohn, Coffey, Pek, & Finkel, 2008; Seligman et al., 2005)
>In other words, a positive new activity, when kept fresh and interesting, can engender experiences that keep a person happier over a longer period than the person’s genetics alone would indicate

They conducted experiment which compare two condition: high-variation and low-variation. They found after 10 weeks, participants in high-variation group are significantly happier than people in low-variation condition. They also found that people in low-validation actually decreased in happiness level.
>This finding suggests that not only does implementing an intentional activity in new and unpredictable ways help bolster one’s well-being, but that repeating an intentional activity without spontaneity and freshness may actually be detrimental to well-being. It

>In conclusion, the two studies we have reported here provide the first support for an important feature of both the SHM and HAP models -- the notion that varying how one does a “positive” activity may be crucial in determining whether that activity continues to have enhancing effects on peoples’ well-being.
