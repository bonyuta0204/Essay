# Draft of Essay of PSY360
## Instruction of the essay

Page: 8 - 12 pages without abstraction, title, references  
Format: APA   
Content: must be structured like a research manuscript (without data). It has to be constructed as three distinctive part.  
### Part1
Introduction and Literature review. Most of citation has to be written in year 2000+. Has to state why it is relevant. You must describe predictions/hypotheses, the rationale for expected findings, as well as descriptions of how these findings add to the existing literature.   
**3 - 4 pages**
### Part2
Part 2) Design a study that would test or expand the idea(s) you have about this topic. 
The study design and procedures should be appropriate for the goals of the study, and be described in enough detail so that it could potentially be replicated. Your proposed sample should be described, including information on recruitment. Address and/or clarify any potential ethical concerns (risks and potential benefits), as relevant. Risks to participants almost always exist and generally fall into psychological, physical, social or group risk categories. In this section, you should also state what data is being collected, the means of data collection (for example, is it a diary method, online, laboratory in-person, etc.), and how the data will be handled/analyzed. Data analysis plans should be appropriate to the design and research question; it should be described in a way that allows another researcher to replicate/conduct these analyses, if they had your (hypothetical) data. Expected results should be described/reiterated.  
** (approx. 4 pages) **

### Part3
Part 3) Applications & Conclusions. This section of your proposal should be focused on benefits to society and real people out there. The findings may have academic merit, but what is the relevance to real life and real people? How does this idea/finding potentially (or actually) benefit people out there in terms of living a full life? Applications described can be focused on non-clinical or clinical applications; however, given the focus of this course, positive psychology, you are encouraged to think beyond clinical applications. In addition, describe the relevance of the study and its findings to positive psychology as a discipline. In your concluding remarks, discuss the potential/expected findings in the context of the existing literature, discuss limitations and directions for future research.

## Research 
### Positive Psychology Progress Empirical Validation of Interventions by Seligman et al.

Emerging science of positive psychology: the study of positive
Emotion, positive character, and positive institutions (Seligman & Csikszentmihalyi, 2000).  
Some studies did a research on application of positive PSY ((Linley & Joseph, 2004).)  
**In this article, we first review the recent growth within
Positive psychology. Next, we describe basic research that bears on whether people can become lastingly happier, and then we present the results of our own happiness interventions that we rigorously tested with a randomized,placebo- controlled design**

We focus the rest of this article on the efficacy of psycho- logical interventions to increase individual happiness,in many ways the bottom line of work in positive psychology

One nonobvious reason to be interested in interventions that build happiness is that happiness is not an epiphenomenon. E.g. happiness is causal and bring many benefit beside feeling good.

>From the Buddha,through the human potential movement of the 1960s,through the pioneering work of Michael Fordyce (1977,1983),through the self-improvement industry of the 1990s,at least 100 ginterventionsh claiming to increase happiness lastingly have been proposed.

>Research into the hedonic treadmill, adaptation, and the heritability of positive affectivity has implied that people adapt rapidly to positive changes in their world and soon return to their baseline levels of happiness (Brickman & Campbell, 1971; Kahneman, 1999; Lykken & Tellegen, 1996

#### Procedure of this experiment
Used internet to find participants and collect data  
Used 5 activities. Each activities are **completed in one week**

#### Result 
Two of these exercise increased happiness and decreased depressive symptoms for **six months**. another one(gratitude visit) largely increased happiness level for one month.surprisingly,The degree to which participants actively continued their assigned exercise on their own and beyond the prescribed one week period mediated the long-term benefits.
###### Comment
Length of research was for six months. Therefore there is possibility that there were longer effect of the intervention.

#### Discussion
What caused the long-term effect?  
Instruction just explicitly stated that perform the intervention for a week.  
The interaction between continuing the exercise and adherence to the exercise was significant for happiness scores, indicating that participants who continued the ex- excises were the happiest.

>We believe that these two interventions involve skills that improve with practice,that are fun,and that thus are self-maintaining.

#### Definitions
Epiphenomenon: a secondary effect or byproduct that arises from but does not causally influence a process.

#### Memo of this article
Memo of this article. this article suggest that positive intervention can last for longer times. Dispite the theory of hedonic treadmill, positive intervention has possibility that it can make long lasting effect on pepople's happiness level. '
It also shows that to continue intervention is essential for long lasting benefit of positive interventions.

### Enhancing Well-Being and Alleviating Depressive Symptoms With Positive Psychology Interventions:A Practice-Friendly Meta-Analysis by Nancy and Lyubormisly

#### Introduction
Increasingly, psycholo- gical well-being (WB) is viewed as not only the absence of mental disorder but also the presence of positive psychological resources, including components of hedonic or subjective well-being (e.g., positive affect, life satisfaction, happiness; Diener, 1984)
>positive psychology interventions (PPIs)?that is, treatment methods or intentional activities that aim to cultivate positive feelings, behaviors, or cognitions. For instance, PPI strategies as diverse as writing gratitude letters, practicing optimistic thinking, replaying positive experi- ences, and socializing have been shown to increase WB in nonclinical samples (e.g., Fordyce, 1977; Lyubomirsky, Dickerhoof, Boehm, & Sheldon, 2008; Ruini, Belaise, Brombin, Caffo, & Fava, 2006)

#### Procedure
**Meta-analysis**
**important**: **All literuture is shorter than 12weeks**

#### Result
>Intervention duration. Longer interventions produced greater gains inWB based on the fixed effects model, and this effect approached significance according to the random effects model (one-tailed p5.09)
>The combined results of 49 studies revealed that PPIs do, in fact, significantly enhance WB, and the combined results of 25 studies showed that PPIs are also effective for treating depressive symptoms. The magnitude of these effects is medium-sized (mean r5.29 for WB, mean r5.31 for depression), indicating that not only do PPIs work, they work well.
> Individual therapy was most effective, followed by group-administered PPIs, then self-administered PPIs
